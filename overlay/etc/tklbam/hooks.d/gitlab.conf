# TurnKey TKLBAM GitLab hook backup/restore config file

# As of v15.2 TurnKey uses the GitLab Omnibus installer and leverages GitLab's
# built-in backup system to collect the required files.
#
# This config file is provided to allow greater user config of the tklbam
# backup.
#
# Note that this file (and the companion hook script) are included as part of
# the backup. If you wish to override the current hook settings when restoring
# your backup, please create a new conf file (in the same location) named
# gitlab-override.conf. E.g.:
#
#  cp /etc/tklbam/hooks.d/gitlab.conf /etc/tklbam/hooks.d/gitlab-override.conf
#
# Any settings in this override file will override settings within the default
# file, but will not be included in any future backups. If you want your new
# settings included in future backups, you will need to adjust the default
# file.

# Note: backup file will be renamed 'gitlab_backup.tar'.
# Original filename will be stored in 'gitlab_backup.tar.filename'.

# GitLab backup/restore options

# For full details of GitLab backup/restore see:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html
#
# GitLab currently provides 2 different backup strategy options. They are:
#
#    stream - streams the data directly from GitLab to the local backup dir
#           - faster and uses less disk space
#           - less reliable; e.g. will fail if files change during backup
#
#    copy   - copies the data first, before creating the backup
#           - slower and uses more disk space
#           - much more reliable as it is backing up a copy of the files
#
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#backup-strategy-option
backup_strategy=copy

# https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#excluding-specific-directories-from-the-backup

# Forces the restore process to accept defaults and work non-interatively.
